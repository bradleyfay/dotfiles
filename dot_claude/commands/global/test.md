Generate comprehensive tests for:

$ARGUMENTS

Test generation guidelines:
1. **Happy path**: Normal, expected inputs
2. **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, null values
3. **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, error conditions
4. **Integration**: How components work together

Include:
- Test descriptions that explain what's being tested
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- Mock/stub setup where needed
- Assertions that verify behavior

Use the appropriate testing framework for the language/project.
