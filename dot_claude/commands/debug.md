Help me debug:

$ARGUMENTS

Debugging approach:
1. **Understand the problem**
   - What's the expected behavior?
   - What's the actual behavior?
   - When did this start happening?

2. **Gather information**
   - Error messages or stack traces
   - Relevant code sections
   - Environment details
   - Steps to reproduce

3. **Hypothesis and testing**
   - Propose likely causes
   - Suggest specific tests to isolate the issue
   - Recommend debugging techniques

4. **Solution**
   - Propose fixes
   - Explain why the fix works
   - Suggest preventive measures

Be systematic and thorough.
